Description of the task:

An array of natural numbers is given, a key element k (k - natural) and naturally number d. Suggest algorithm and realize the function to find all elements x in array, for which | k - x.key | <= d.

Description of the solution:

To be valid | k - x.key | <= d, the expression "k-x.key" have to be between -d and d or -d <= k - x.key <= d.
