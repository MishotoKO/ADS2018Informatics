### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
Algorithm

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

Sorting is typically done in-place, by iterating up the array, growing the sorted list behind it. At each array-position, it checks the value there against the largest value in the sorted list (which happens to be next to it, in the previous array-position checked). If larger, it leaves the element in place and moves to the next. 
If smaller, it finds the correct position within the sorted list, shifts all the larger values up to make a space, and inserts into that correct position.

The resulting array after k iterations has the property where the first k + 1 entries are sorted ("+1" because the first entry is skipped). In each iteration the first remaining entry of the input is removed, and inserted into the result at the correct position, 

// Sort an arr[] of size n
insertionSort(arr, n)
Loop from i = 1 to n-1.

12, 11, 13, 5, 6

Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 5 (Size of input array)

i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
11, 12, 13, 5, 6

i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13
11, 12, 13, 5, 6

i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
5, 11, 12, 13, 6

i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
5, 6, 11, 12, 13

### Heapsort

Algorithm

The heapsort algorithm involves preparing the list by first turning it into a max heap. 
The algorithm then repeatedly swaps the first value of the list with the last value, decreasing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and sifting the new first value into its position in the heap. 
This repeats until the range of considered values is one value in length.

The steps are:

Call the buildMaxHeap() function on the list. Also referred to as heapify(), this builds a heap from a list in O(n) operations.
Swap the first element of the list with the final element. Decrease the considered range of the list by one.
Call the siftDown() function on the list to sift the new first element to its appropriate index in the heap.
Go to step (2) unless the considered range of the list is one element.
The buildMaxHeap() operation is run once, and is O(n) in performance. The siftDown() function is O(log n), and is called n times. Therefore, the performance of this algorithm is O(n + n log n) = O(n log n).

### Selection Sort

Algorithm

Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depend on the data in the array. Selecting the minimum requires scanning n elements (taking n-1 comparisons) and then swapping it into the first position. 
Finding the next lowest element requires scanning the remaining n-1 elements and so on.

### Bubble Sort

The bubble sort algorithm can be easily optimized by observing that the n-th pass finds the n-th largest element and puts it into its final place. So, the inner loop can avoid looking at the last n âˆ’ 1 items when running for the n-th time:

```
procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
    n = length(A)
    repeat
        swapped = false
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                swapped = true
            end if
        end for
        n = n - 1
    until not swapped
end procedure
```

More generally, it can happen that more than one element is placed in their final position on a single pass. 
In particular, after every pass, all elements after the last swap are sorted, and do not need to be checked again. 
This allows us to skip over a lot of the elements, resulting in about a worst case 50% improvement in comparison count (though no improvement in swap counts), 
and adds very little complexity because the new code subsumes the "swapped" variable:
To accomplish this in pseudocode we write the following:

```
procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
    n = length(A)
    repeat
        newn = 0
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                newn = i
            end if
        end for
        n = newn
    until n <= 1
end procedure
```

Alternate modifications, such as the cocktail shaker sort attempt to improve on the bubble sort performance while keeping the same idea of repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent items.
