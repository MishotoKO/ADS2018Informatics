Degree definitions:

In-degree: For a directed graph G=(V(G),E(G)) and a vertex x1?V(G), the Out-Degree of x1 refers to the number of arcs incident from x1. That is, the number of arcs directed away from the vertex x1. The In-Degree of x1 refers to the number of arcs incident to x1. That is, the number of arcs directed towards the vertex x1. In short: The number of inward directed graph edges from a given graph vertex in a directed graph.

Out-degree: For a directed graph G=(V(G),E(G)), the Out-Degree Sequence is a sequence obtained by ordering the out-degrees of all vertices in V(G) in increasing order. The In-Degree Sequence is a sequence obtained by ordering the in-degrees of all vertices in V(G) in increasing order. In short: The number of outward directed graph edges from a given graph vertex in a directed graph.

Remark 1: In an undirected graph the total number vertices is the degree

General idea to finish the solution: Using induction. Set your vertices up in a linear fashion. The one endpoint vertex has all outgoing arcs to other vertices, and then self-loops to account for the in-degree. The other end-point vertex has no outgoing arcs. The vertices in the middle each have an appropriate number of self-loops as well as arcs to the each of the next vertices in line.

Remark 2: This method will only work with a predifined directed graph.
