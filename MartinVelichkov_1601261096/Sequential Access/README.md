# Sequential Access

## Algorithms

The selected list contains some algorithms with a sequential access to elements. Typically these types of algorithms require more iteractions.

1. **Bubble sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Rabbit and Turtle** - we prepare two pointers. One is a turtle and the other is a rabbit. A turtle is moved by one. At the same time, a rabbit is moved by two. After starting at the same start point, then if the turtle meets up the rabbit again, it means this liked list has a loop. However, the rabbit reaches a goal (the last node) ahead of the turtle. Which means this liked list is straight.

3. **Cocktail shaker sort** is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort.

4. **Comb sort** is a relatively simple sorting algorithm. Comb sort improves on bubble sort.
