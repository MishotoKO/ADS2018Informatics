These are the best and worst case execution times of several 
comparison sorting algorithms.

Tree Sort
	Worst 	- n ^ 2 (unbalanced) or n * log(n) (balanced)
	Best 	- n * log(n)

Insertion Sort
	Worst 	- n^2
	Best  	- n
	
Shell Insertion Sort
	Worst	- Depends on gap sequence
	Best	- n

Bubble Sort
	Worst 	- n ^ 2
	Best	- n
	
Cocktail shaker sort
	Worst 	- n ^ 2
	Best 	- n
	
Hoare Quicksort
	Worst	- n ^ 2
	Best	- n * log(n)
	
Comb Sort (Tortoise and Hare)
	Worst 	- n ^ 2
	Best	- n * log(n)
	
Selection Sort 
	Worst 	- n ^ 2 comparisons, n swaps
	Best	- n ^ 2 comparisons, n swaps
	
Heapsort
	Worst	- n * log(n)
	Best	- n * log(n) distinct keys or n with equal keys
