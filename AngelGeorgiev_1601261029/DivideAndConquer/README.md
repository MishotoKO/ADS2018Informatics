Is it true if the following algorithms use the divide and conquer strategy? Why?

Quicksort - True. The problem is divided based on the pivot. This is done recursively.

Pyramid Sort - Partially. Has the time complexity of a 'divide and conquer' algorithm.

Binary Insertion Sort - See Binary Search. 

Binary Search - True. Divides the array at every iteration, thus narrowind down the search.

Fibonacci Search - True. Divides the array into two parts that have sizes that are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

Interpolation Search - False. Interpolation search narrows down its search space based on the key of the sought item.

Shannon-Fano Algorithm - True. Symbols are divided into sets depending on probablities.

Huffman Algorithm - False.
