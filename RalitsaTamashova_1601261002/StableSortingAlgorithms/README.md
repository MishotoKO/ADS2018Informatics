What is stable sorting method?

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. If we are sorting a students with their marks like<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike, A; Stephnie, B; John, B; Michelle, A; - is the input of the program<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike, A; Michelle, A; Stephanie, B; John, B; - should be the output, because the order of the students with the same marks is the same as before sorting.<br/>

Stable sorting methods are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Count Sort.
