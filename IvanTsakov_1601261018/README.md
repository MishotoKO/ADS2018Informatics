# ADS2018Informatics-> Ivan Tsakov. Informatics 3. 

## Hello there folks. My name is Ivan and I'll be posting some of my tasks for c# course. I'll mostly work with python. 

## How to run the solutions:
To install python on Windows -> <https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/>
To install python on Linux -> You have python installed but if you want to install better version or install it at all check this - <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/>
** For best experience I would recommend to run the solutions in the terminal by executing the program via following -> python "solution_name.py"**


#### First solution will cover binary conversion to decimal and backwards:
---->You can find the solution here [Binary Conversions](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/blob/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/binaryAlgorithm/binaryAlgorithm.py) 

#### Second solution will show you 2 sorts one is bubble the other is python sorted:
---->You can find the solution here [Sorting](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/Sorting)

#### Third solution is priority queue. It shifts the element with the most binary value in the first position of the list.:
---->You can find the solution here [Priority Queue](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/PriorityQueue)

#### Fourth solution will show you benchmarks of some sorting methods:
---->You can find the solution here [Sorting Benchmark](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/SortingBenchmark)

#### Fifth solution will let you input a string and search in a text for that string:
---->You can find the solution here [Search String](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/SearchString)

#### Sixth solution covers one of the problems of the Duke competition of 1993:
---->You can find the solution here [Duke programming problem H](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/Duke%20programming%20problem%20H)

#### Seventh solution will show the undirected graph and will show if there is a cycle that goes through it:
---->You can find the solution here [Maximum Cycle](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/MaximumCycle)


#### Eighth solution is closest pair of points:
---->You can find the solution here [Maximum Cycle](https://github.com/IvanTsakov/ADS2018Informatics/tree/master/IvanTsakov_1601261018/closestPoints)
