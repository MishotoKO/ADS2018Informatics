				Binary Search Tree

1. In this task I have tried to create a Binary Search Tree (BST).
2. To open this file you need to click on the "BinaryTreeTask" with the "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution" type. 
3. To run the program you can press "F5" for a quick start of the program.
4. This program, for now, has two methods - "Main"; "BinaryTreeNode";	
5. In the methods there is:
 - Main - we have a binary tree model that has two childs and one root. The Root is "2", and the left and right children are "7" and "5". In these children we have more children of the root's children. The "Left.Left" or "Right.Left" are the extentions for the smallest children of the left and of the right child, so the prgram can understand where these other numbers are placed.  -- There has to be a "Traverse" method (in bulgarian "Обхождания"), for the "Root Left Right"; "Left Root Right"; "Right Left Root"; 
 - "BinaryTreeNode" method there are get and set methods for the left and right child.
