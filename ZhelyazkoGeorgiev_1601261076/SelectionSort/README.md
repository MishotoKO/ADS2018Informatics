			    Selection Sort 

1. This is a Selection Sort built in C# - Visual Studio 2017.
2. To open this file the "SelectionSort" file with the 
"Microsoft Visual Studio Solution" type.
3. To run the program you need to press the "F5" button for a quick
start of the solution.
4. In this solution you will find, as I mentioned, a Selection sort program.
It is a random generating method in the range of 0 to 100, but i have decided
to get the first 5 randomly generated numbers. In the file there are three 
methods - "Main"; "SelectionSort"; "Write";
 - In the "SelectionSort" method there are two for loops that and an if
statement in which the randomly generated nubmers that will show in the output of this program are generated from the largest to the smalles number.
 - In the "Write" method there is a foreach statement in which there are stored the arrays via items and printed lateron.
 - In the "Main" method there is the random statement; the int[] statement where I declare how many numbers I wish to be displyed in the console; a for loop gets 5 elements one by one; and finally the printing in the console by calling out the previous two methods and in the "Console.Write()" is where the unsorted and the sorted nubmers are separated;
