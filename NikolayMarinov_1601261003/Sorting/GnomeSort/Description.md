## Title:
Gnome sort of an array

## Brief description: 
The program looks at each two elements if the next is larger than the previous it swaps them it then steps one step foreward and repeats the process 
if there is no next element it knows it is at the end of the array and if there is no previous it knows it is at the beginning.
