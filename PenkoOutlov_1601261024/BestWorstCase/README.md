Comparison between the speed of sorting algorithms.

Sorting algorithms:
- Quicksort
    - best case: n log n
    - average: n log n
    - worst: n^2
- Merge sort
    - best case: n log n
    - average: n log n
    - worst: n log n
- Heap sort
    - best case: n if all keys are distinct otherwise n log n
    - average: n log n
    - worst: n log n
- Insertion sort
    - best case: n
    - average: n^2
    - worst: n^2
- Selection sort
    - best case: n^2
    - average: n^2
    - worst: n^2
- Cubesort
    - best case: n
    - average: n log n
    - worst: n log n
- Shell sort
    - best case: n log n
    - average: depends on gap sequence
    - worst: depends on gap sequence; best know is n log n
- Bubble sort
    - best case: n
    - average: n^2
    - worst: n^2
- Binary tree sort
    - best case: n log n
    - average: n log n
    - worst: n log n (if balanced)
- Cocktail sort
    - best case: n
    - average: n^2
    - worst: n^2
- Comb sort
    - best case: n log n
    - average: n^2
    - worst: n^2
